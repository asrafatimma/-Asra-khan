I'm **[Asra Khan]**, a passionate **Data Analytics Engineer**. I focus on developing and managing data engineering projects, leveraging a variety of tools and frameworks to build efficient and robust data solutions. I tackle each project with a proactive mindset, consistently learning and implementing best practices. My commitment to sustainability also drives me to complete tasks in the most eco-friendly manner possible.

I understand the importance of theoretical knowledge in data engineering. As such, I stay informed about distributed computing principles, big data applications, streaming data management, pipeline scheduling and orchestration, cloud environments, and more. Alongside these concepts, I'm dedicated to refining my coding skills, particularly in **Python** and **SQL**, writing complex scripts and queries to solve various challenges.

Feel free to explore my data engineering projects on this GitHub repository. Welcome!
